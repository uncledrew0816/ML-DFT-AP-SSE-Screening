# ML-DFT-for-APs
## Project Overview
This project aims to identify new antiperovskite materials using a **high-throughput screening** approach that combines **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**. 
The screening criteria include **tolerance factor**, **thermodynamic stability**, **electronic conductivity**, **electrochemical stability**, **mechanical stability**, and **ionic conductivity**. 
The scripts are designed to run in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python.
